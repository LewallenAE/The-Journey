/*


Selector selects a specific element 

h1 {
}

.class {
}

# id {
}

section > h1 {
}

.className h1 {
}

etc


NOTE you ARE allowed to give something multiple classes such as

<article class="firstClass secondClass thirdClass fourthClass"> Stuff here can be styled with first second third and fourth class</article>

This is NOT an example of multiple classes

<article class="firstClass-secondClass-thirdClass-fourthClass"> Stuff here can only be styled with one class which is the class name of 
firstClass-secondClass-thirdClass-fourthClass</article>

.body p#blue {
}.   this will select the body class with a p tag id named blue so something like this

<article class="body">

<h1> Not this one </h1>
<p>Not this one either</p>
<p id="blue"> This particle one will be selected</p>
<div> <p> Not this one </p> 
</div>


</article>
